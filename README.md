# MarkdownConverter
Provides the functionallity to convert MarkDown-files to html, png, or pdf using Visual Studio Code.

# Known Issues

  - Dynamic Footer/Header-heights aren't supported by PhantomJS.  
    For that reason all Headers/Footers will have the height of the default Header/Footer.  
    I'm sorry...

## Conception
### Variable-Priority
```
Frontmatter > Config > Default Config
```
