## Usage

 1. Set your desired conversion-types or skip this step to convert your markdown-file to `PDF`:
      - Open up your Visual Studio Code-Settings and set `markdownConverter.conversionType` to either your desired type or an array of types:  
        ```json
        {
          "markdownConverter.conversionType": "PNG"
        }
        ```
        or
        ```json
        {
          "markdownConverter.conversionType": [
            "HTML",
            "PDF"
          ]
        }
        ```
 2. Open up the command pallet (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>) and search for `Markdown: Convert` (`Markdown: Konvertieren` in German) or `mco` (`mk` in German) for short
 3. Press enter and wait for the process to finish

## Features and more

If you have any further questions or want to know more about the features of MarkdownConverter have a look at the [MarkdownConverter-Wiki][MarkdownConverterWiki].

# Known Issues

  - Dynamic Footer/Header-heights aren't supported by PhantomJS.  
    For that reason all Headers/Footers will have the height of the default Header/Footer.  
    I'm sorry...
  - Anchor-links inside a PDF-document are not working due to an issue of PhantomJS.
